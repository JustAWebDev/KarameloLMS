<h2>The original strategic bomber</h2>
<p>
The Bear A was the original strategic bomber and many were subsequently re-built to later G versions. The Bear B was used to carry the AS-3 Kangaroo stand-off missile and had a chin radome housing the Crown Drum radar. The Bear-D was designed for oceanic surveillance and ship targeting and equipped the Naval Air Force. The former bomb-bay housed a Big Bulge radar operating in the I-band. The Bear-E is a dedicated photo reconnaissance version with 6 or 7 cameras in the lower fuselage and various other oblique cameras. The Bear F was a dedicated sub-hunter. The Bear G was a re-build of earlier A models and was equipped with a Crown Drum radar and carried a variety of stand-off missiles, including the AS-4 Kitchen. The Bear H was designed to carry the AS-15 Kent cruise</p>
