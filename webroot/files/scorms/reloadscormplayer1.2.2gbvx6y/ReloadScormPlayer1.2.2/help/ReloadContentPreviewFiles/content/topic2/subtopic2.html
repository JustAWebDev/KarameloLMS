<span class="HEAD">Installation (Microsoft Windows)</span><br>
To install the RELOAD software, download the most recent install file from <a href="http://www.reload.ac.uk/download/">http://www.reload.ac.uk/download/</a>. The download file is approximately 18Mb. This equates to a download time of around 75 minutes on a 56kbps modem (assumes sustained transfer rates of 4k/s). Obviously the download time will be much reduced if you use a broadband or an institutional connection.</p><p align="center"><img src="../img/playersetupicon.gif" alt="Setup Icon" border="0"></P><P> Once download is complete, simply double click on the Installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  The installation allows you to choose where to install the software. </p><P> RELOAD SCORM Player is installed to 'C:\Program Files\ReloadTools\ScormPlayer\' by default, although you can of course change the location. Once installation is finished you can launch the RELOAD SCORM Player by clicking on the Start Menu and finding its' Program Group:</p><P align="center"><img src="../img/scormplayerprogramgroup.gif" alt="Program Group" width="405" height="49" border="0"></P>

The download file is approximately 5.3Mb.  This equates to a download time of around 25 minutes on a 56kbps modem (assumes sustained transfer rates of 4k/s).
