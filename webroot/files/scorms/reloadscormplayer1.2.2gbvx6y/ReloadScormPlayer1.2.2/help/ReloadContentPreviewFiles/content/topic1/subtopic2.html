The RELOAD tools are a set of tools developed to allow educational content developers to utilise the specifications being produced by bodies such as IMS and ADL. At present we produce two peices of software, the RELOAD Editor and the RELOAD SCORM Player.

RELOAD Editor is a Content Package and Metadata Editor.  With RELOAD Editor, you can create, import, edit, and export Content Packages.  RELOAD SCORM Player allows you to view (and examine the functionality of) ADL SCORM 1.2 Packages.
