<h2>Tupolev TU-95 Bear</h2>

<p> The Tupolev Bear is the fastest propeller-driven aircraft ever flown and as such is something of a triumph of clever aerodynamics married to 4 enormously powerful Kuznetsov NK-12MV turboprop engines. Originally designed as a bomber back in the early 1950’s it entered service in 1956.</p>
