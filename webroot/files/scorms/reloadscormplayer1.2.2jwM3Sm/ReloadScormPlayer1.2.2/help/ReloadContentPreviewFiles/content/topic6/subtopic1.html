<span class="HEAD">RELOAD SCORM Player</span><br>
The RELOAD SCORM 1.2 Player Workspace basically consists of three panes: a Packages pane (left), an Organizations pane (centre), and a CMI Datamodel pane (right). The packages pane lists all the SCORM Packages which the Player knows about.  You can choose to play any package in this pane. The Organizations pane is the key area as this space presents the structure of the SCORM Package - showing the hierarchical organisation of resources, identifying the sco's by adding the suffix (sco) to their item name. The CMI (Computer Managed Instruction) Datamodel pane shows the status of the package (information being recorded).  This information updates in real time as the user progresses through the course and their progress is tracked and recorded.</p>

<P>Typically, the user loads a SCORM Package into the player, selects the SCO they are interested in and examines the status of the CMI Datamodel.  They then play the Package (the Tomcat server starts automatically) and navigate through the package (see below) before returning to the Player to view changes to the CMI Datamodel for the sco being watched.</P><hr>
