This section takes you through the opening and playback of a SCORM 1.2 Content Package. 
</p>
<p>To understand fully the facilities offered by RELOAD SCORM 1.2 Player, you should examine an existing SCORM Package. The pages which follow lead you through all the stages in opening, previewing and 'playing' an existing SCORM package. For this purpose we will use one of the exemplar SCORM1.2 packages from ADL:  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.adlnet.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=rcdetails&libid=32&filterid=24&page=1&keywords=&applyto=libTitle,libAuthor,contentText">http://www.adlnet.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=rcdetails&libid=32&filterid=24&page=1&keywords=&applyto=libTitle,libAuthor,contentText</a>.  You are taken to a web page on the ADL SCORM web site which links to a zip file of SCORM content (895k). Unzip the file and look for the sub-folder entitled 'SingleCourse'.  This folder contains a single zipped Content Package SingleCourseEx.zip containing a course on Maritime Navigation that ADL have released as a 'Demonstration of one possible way to package a Course in a Content Package'. Retrieve this zip and place it in a folder where you can find it from within the RELOAD SCORM 1.2 Player. 
</p><p>
The example package is a short course on Maritime Navigation.  It consists of a set of web pages that have been aggregated together as a SCORM Content Package.  SCORM elements have been utilised to define a set of rules that can be utilised by any LMS to govern progression through the materials by students.  For instance, progression may be dependent upon a student having looked at a previous resource (Prerequisites), achieving a specific score in a test (Mastery Score), or completing a task within a defined timeframe (Max Time Allowed, Time Limit Action).  Control of progression etc. is mediated through a JavaScript API which allows the LMS to communicate with the content through the CMI Datamodel.  As we will see, as the learner progresses through the content, their progress is tracked and recorded.  The RELOAD SCORM 1.2 Player allows the user to follow the student view and the management view side by side.  This is useful if we wish to test that a SCORM Package behaves as expected.  In the next section we will open and play the example content package, following the student and data views.
