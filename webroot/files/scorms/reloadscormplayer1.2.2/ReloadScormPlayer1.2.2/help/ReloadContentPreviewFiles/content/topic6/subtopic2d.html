<span class="HEAD">Tools Menu</span><br>
The tools menu has a single item: Options.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../img/playertoolsmenu.gif" alt="tools menu" width="261" height="127" border="0"></p>
<P>
Clicking Options brings up a 4 pane tabbed dialogue box.

<P>This <strong>General Preferences</strong> Pane allows the user to set a default opening folder, useful when SCORM 1.2 Packages are stored together. 

For the Reload Scorm Player to run correctly, there must be a special folder copied to your user account. This is done automatically by the software. However, if this folder was to become corrupted or accidentally deleted for some reason, then the Player may not function correctly. To avoid this, we recommend you leave the "repair startup folder" checked. This makes sure that the necessary folder is present and correct, if not the software will check and repair it if needed before launch.

<P>The <strong>LMS Options</strong> Pane allows control of the behaviour of the LMS. 
<ul><li>The CMI Datamodel has values for UserID and Username. Here you can change these values to your own Username and UserID (purely for display purposes, the username and UserID mean nothing).
<li>The option to 'Show tree widget in player' controls whether the organisational structure of the package is shown within the LMS.  This option is checked by default. 
<li>The option 'Show navigation in player' controls whether explicit navigation buttons are shown in the LMS. This option is checked by default. 
<!-- <li>The option 'Enable auto progression of items in player' controls whether the next item in the course is automatically loaded by the sequencer, once a particular sco has been completed. Note: This feature is best enabled when a SCORM package contains only sco's and each sco requires user interaction, such as clicking a 'done' button, to continue. (removed for v1.2)-->
</ul>
</P>
<P align="center"><img src="../img/playerprefs3.gif" width="503" height="253" alt="" border="0"></P>
<P>The <strong>Server Options</strong> Pane allows the user to decide which port to run the Tomcat server on. Port 8080 is the default, but you can change this to another one if you have software already using this port. The Reload Scorm Player will detect if this port is already in use and show a message telling you to change the port number. It is recommended to increment to port 8081, if you have some other software using port 8080.</P>
<P align="center"><img src="../img/playerprefs4.gif" width="503" height="253" alt="" border="0"></P>
<P>The <strong>Appearance</strong> Pane allows you to choose the default 'Look and Feel' for the SCORM 1.2 Player.
