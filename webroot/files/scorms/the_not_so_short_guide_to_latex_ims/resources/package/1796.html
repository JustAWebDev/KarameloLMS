               <a name="dx1-84001"></a>pdfLaTeX can deal with all sorts of fonts (PK bitmaps, TrueType,
            <span class="sc">PostScript</span><a name="dx1-84002"></a> type&nbsp;1&#8230;) but the normal LaTeX font format, the bitmap PK fonts
            produce very ugly results when the document is displayed with Acrobat Reader.
            It is best to use <span class="sc">PostScript</span><a name="dx1-84003"></a> Type 1 fonts exclusively to produce documents that
            display well. <span class="emphasis"><em>Modern TeX installations will be setup so that this happens
                automatically. Best is to try. If it works for you, just skip this whole
                section.
            </em></span>
        </p><p>
               The <span class="sc">PostScript</span><a name="dx1-84004"></a> Type 1 implementation of the Computer Modern and
            AMSFonts was produced by Blue Sky Research and Y&amp;Y, Inc., who then
            transferred copyright to the American Mathematical Society. The fonts were
            made publicly available in early 1997 and currently come with most of TE X
            distributions.
        </p><p>   However, if you are using LaTeX to create documents in languages other than
            English, you might want to use EC, LH, or CB fonts (see the discussion about
            <span class="tt">OT1</span> fonts on the page&nbsp;??). Vladimir Volovich has created the cm-super font
            bundle which covers the entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH font
            sets. It is available from <span class="tt">CTAN:/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super</span> and is included
            with TE XLive7 and MikTE X. Similar type&nbsp;1 CB Greek fonts created by
            Apostolos Syropoulos are available at <span class="tt">CTAN:/tex-archive/fonts/greek/cb</span>.
            Unfortunately, both of these font sets are not of the same typographic quality
            as the Type1 CM fonts by Blue Sky/Y&amp;Y. They were automatically
            hinted, and the document might look not as neat on the screen as the
            ones using Blue Sky/Y&amp;Y type 1 CM fonts, on high resolution output
            devices they produce results identical to the original bitmap EC/LH/CB
            fonts.
        </p><p>   If you are creating document in one of Latin-based languages, you have
            several other options.
            
            
            
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    You might want to use <a name="dx1-84005"></a><a name="dx1-84006"></a><span class="sf">aeguill</span> package, aka <span class="emphasis"><em>Almost European Computer
                        Modern with Guillemets
                    </em></span>
                    .Just put the line
                    <em><span class="remark">\usepackage{aeguill}</span></em><a name="dx1-84007"></a><a name="dx1-84008"></a> into the preamble of your document, to enable
                    AE virtual fonts instead of EC fonts.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    Alternatively, you can use <a name="dx1-84009"></a><a name="dx1-84010"></a><span class="sf">mltex</span> package, but this only works when
                    your pdfTE X has been compiled with the <a name="dx1-84011"></a>mltex option.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>The AE virtual fontset, like the MlTE X system, makes TE X believe it has a full 256
            character fontset at its disposal by creating most of the missing letters from
            characters of the CM font and rearranging them in the EC order, this allows to
            use the excellent type 1 format CM fonts available on most systems. As the font
            is now in T1 encoding, hyphenation will work well in Latin-based European
            languages. The only disadvantage of this approach is that the artificial
            AE characters do not work with Acrobat Reader&#8217;s <span class="tt">Find</span> function, so
            you cannot search for words with accented characters in your final PDF
            file.
        </p><p>   For the Russian language a similar solution is to use C1 virtual fonts available
            at <span class="tt">ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/font-packs/c1fonts</span>. These fonts combine the
            standard CM type&nbsp;1 fonts from Bluesky collection and CMCYR type&nbsp;1 fonts
            from Paradissa and BaKoMa collection, all available on CTAN. Because
            Paradissa fonts contain only Russian letters, C1 fonts are missing other Cyrillic
            glyphs.
        </p><p>
               Another solution is to switch to other <span class="sc">PostScript</span><a name="dx1-84012"></a> type&nbsp;1 fonts. Actually,
            some of them are even included with every copy of Acrobat Reader. Because
            these fonts have different character sizes, the text layout on your pages will
            change. Generally these other fonts will use more space than the CM fonts, which
            are very space-efficient. Also, the overall visual coherence of your document will
            suffer because Times, Helvetica and Courier (the primary candidates for such a
            replacement job) have not been designed to work in harmony in a single
            document.
        </p><p>
               Two ready-made font sets are available for this purpose: <a name="dx1-84013"></a><a name="dx1-84014"></a><span class="sf">pxfonts</span>, which is
            based on <span class="emphasis"><em>Palatino</em></span> as its main text body font, and the <a name="dx1-84015"></a><a name="dx1-84016"></a><span class="sf">txfonts</span> package, which is
            based on <span class="emphasis"><em>Times</em></span>. To use them it is sufficient to put the following lines into the
            preamble of your document:
            
            
            
        </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\usepackage{pxfonts}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>   Note: you may find lines like
            
            
            
        </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning:&nbsp;pdftex&nbsp;(file&nbsp;eurmo10):&nbsp;Font&nbsp;eur...&nbsp;not&nbsp;found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>
               in the <span class="tt">.log</span> file after compiling your input file. They mean that some font
            used in the document has not been found. You really have to fix these problems,
            as the resulting PDF document may <span class="emphasis"><em>not display the pages with the missing
                characters at all
            </em></span>
            .
        </p><p>   As you can see this whole font business, especially the lack of a good
            EC fontset equivalent in quality to the CM font in type&nbsp;1 format, has
            been occupying many peoples minds. Recently a new set of high quality
            outline fonts called Latin Modern (LM) has become available. It puts an
            end to the misery. If you have a recent TE X installation, chances are
            that you already have a copy of them installed all you need todo is to
            add
            
            
            
        </p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\usepackage{lmodern}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\usepackage{textcomp}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>to the preamble of your document and you are all set for creating excellent pdf
            output with full support for the full Latin character set.
