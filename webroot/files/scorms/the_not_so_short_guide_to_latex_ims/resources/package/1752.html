                       TE X is a computer program created by <a name="dx1-8001"></a>Donald E. Knuth [<span class="citation">[?]</span>]. It is aimed at
                    typesetting text and mathematical formulae. Knuth started writing the
                    TE X typesetting engine in 1977 to explore the potential of the digital
                    printing equipment that was beginning to infiltrate the publishing industry
                    at that time, especially in the hope that he could reverse the trend of
                    deteriorating typographical quality that he saw affecting his own books
                    and articles. TE X as we use it today was released in 1982, with some
                    slight enhancements added in 1989 to better support 8-bit characters
                    and multiple languages. TE X is renowned for being extremely stable, for
                    running on many different kinds of computers, and for being virtually
                    bug free. The version number of TE X is converging to

                    or in the Scottish &#8220;Loch.&#8221; The &#8220;ch&#8221; originates from the Greek alphabet where
                    X is the letter &#8220;ch&#8221; or &#8220;chi&#8221;. TE X is also the first syllable of the Greek
                    word texnologia (technology). In an ASCII environment, TE X becomes

                    work at the highest typographical quality, using a predefined, professional layout.
                    LaTeX was originally written by <a name="dx1-9001"></a>Leslie Lamport&nbsp;[<span class="citation">[?]</span>]. It uses the TE X formatter
                    as its typesetting engine. These days LaTeX is maintained by <a name="dx1-9002"></a>Frank
                    Mittelbach.

                            soft &#8220;ch&#8221; sound from &#8220;Pech&#8221; would be a more appropriate. Asked about this, Knuth wrote in
                            the German Wikipedia: <span class="emphasis"><em>I do not get angry when people pronounce TE X in their favorite way &#8230;
                                and in Germany many use a soft ch because the X follows the vowel e, not the harder ch that
                                follows the vowel a. In Russia, &#8216;tex&#8217; is a very common word, pronounced &#8216;tyekh&#8217;. But I believe the
                                most proper pronunciation is heard in Greece, where you have the harsher ch of ach and
                                Loch.
