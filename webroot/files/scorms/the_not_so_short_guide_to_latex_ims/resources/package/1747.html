               LaTeX [<span class="citation">[?]</span>] is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing scientific
            and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It is also suitable for
            producing all sorts of other documents, from simple letters to complete books.
            LaTeX uses TE X [<span class="citation">[?]</span>] as its formatting engine.

               This short introduction describes LaTeX2
            <img src="lshort-base3x.png">
            and should be sufficient for most
            applications of LaTeX. Refer to&nbsp;[<span class="citation">[?,&nbsp;?]</span>] for a complete description of the LaTeX
            system.

                        documents. You will
                        also learn a bit about the history of LaTeX. After reading this chapter,
                        you should have a rough understanding how LaTeX works.

                    Chapter 2

                        the essential LaTeX commands and environments. After reading this
                        chapter, you will be able to write your first documents.

                        demonstrate how to use one of LaTeX&#8217;s main strengths. At the end
                        of the chapter are tables listing all mathematical symbols available in
                        LaTeX.

                        graphics. It introduces creation of PDF documents with pdfLaTeX and

                        a picture with some graphics program, saving it to a file and then
                        including it into LaTeX you describe the picture and have LaTeX draw
                        it for you.

                        the standard document layout produced by LaTeX. It will tell you how
                        to change things such that the beautiful output of LaTeX turns ugly
                        or stunning, depending on your abilities.
                    </p></dd></dl></div><p>It is important to read the chapters in order&#8212;the book is not that big, after all. Be
            sure to carefully read the examples, because a lot of the information is in the
            examples placed throughout the book.
        </p><p>LaTeX is available for most computers, from the PC and Mac to large UNIX and
            VMS systems. On many university computer clusters you will find that a LaTeX
            installation is available, ready to use. Information on how to access the local
            LaTeX installation should be provided in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Local Guide</em></span>&nbsp;[<span class="citation">[?]</span>]. If you have
            problems getting started, ask the person who gave you this booklet. The scope of
            this document is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to tell you how to install and set up a LaTeX system, but to
            teach you how to write your documents so that they can be processed
            by&nbsp;LaTeX.
        </p><p>If you need to get hold of any LaTeX related material, have a look at one of
            the Comprehensive TE X Archive Network (<span class="tt">CTAN</span>) sites. The homepage
            is at <span class="tt">http://www.ctan.org</span>. All packages can also be retrieved from
            the ftp archive <span class="tt">ftp://www.ctan.org</span> and its mirror sites all over the
            world.
        </p><p>   You will find other references to CTAN throughout the book, especially
            pointers to software and documents you might want to download. Instead of
            writing down complete urls, I just wrote <span class="tt">CTAN:</span> followed by whatever location
            within the CTAN tree you should go to.
        </p><p>   If you want to run LaTeX on your own computer, take a look at what is
            available from 
            <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems" target="_blank">
                <em><span class="remark">CTAN:/tex-archive/systems</span></em>

            .
        </p><p>If you have ideas for something to be added, removed or altered in this
            document, please let me know. I am especially interested in feedback from LaTeX
            novices about which bits of this intro are easy to understand and which could be
            explained better.
