                </h4></div></div></div><p>   To publish something, authors give their typed manuscript to a publishing
                    company. One of their book designers then decides the layout of the document
                    (column width, fonts, space before and after headings,&nbsp;&#8230;). The book designer
                    writes his instructions into the manuscript and then gives it to a typesetter, who
                    typesets the book according to these instructions.
                </p><p>   A human book designer tries to find out what the author had in mind while
                    writing the manuscript. He decides on chapter headings, citations, examples,
                    formulae, etc.&nbsp;based on his professional knowledge and from the contents of the
                    manuscript.
                </p><p>   In a LaTeX environment, LaTeX takes the role of the book designer and uses
                    TE X as its typesetter. But LaTeX is &#8220;only&#8221; a program and therefore needs more
                    guidance. The author has to provide additional information to describe the
                    logical structure of his work. This information is written into the text as &#8220;LaTeX
                    commands.&#8221;
                </p><p>   This  is  quite  different  from  the
                    <a name="dx1-11001"></a>WYSIWYG<a name="x1-11002f2"></a>
                    <sup>[<a name="d0e477" href="#ftn.d0e477">2</a>]</sup>
                    approach that most modern word processors, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>MS Word</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Corel
                        WordPerfect
                    </em></span>
                    ,take. With these applications, authors specify the document layout
                    interactively while typing text into the computer. They can see on the screen how
                    the final work will look when it is printed.
                </p><p>   When using LaTeX it is not normally possible to see the final output while
                    typing the text, but the final output can be previewed on the screen after
                    processing the file with LaTeX. Then corrections can be made before actually
                    sending the document to the printer.

                </h4></div></div></div><p>   Typographical design is a craft. Unskilled authors often commit serious
                    formatting errors by assuming that book design is mostly a question of
                    aesthetics&#8212;&#8220;If a document looks good artistically, it is well designed.&#8221; But as a
                    document has to be read and not hung up in a picture gallery, the readability
                    and understandability is much more important than the beautiful look of it.
                    Examples:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The font size and the numbering of headings have to be chosen to
                            make the structure of chapters and sections clear to the reader.
                        </p></li><li><p>The line length has to be short enough not to strain the eyes of the
                            reader, while long enough to fill the page beautifully.
                        </p></li></ul></div><p>
                       With <a name="dx1-12001"></a>WYSIWYG systems, authors often generate aesthetically pleasing
                    documents with very little or inconsistent structure. LaTeX prevents such
                    formatting errors by forcing the author to declare the <span class="emphasis"><em>logical</em></span> structure of his
                    document. LaTeX then chooses the most suitable layout.
                </p><p>

                       When people from the <a name="dx1-13001"></a>WYSIWYG world meet people who use LaTeX, they
                    often discuss &#8220;the <a name="dx1-13002"></a>advantages of LaTeX over a normal word processor&#8221; or the
                    opposite. The best thing you can do when such a discussion starts is to keep a
                    low profile, since such discussions often get out of hand. But sometimes you
                    cannot escape &#8230;
                </p><p>So here is some ammunition. The main advantages of LaTeX over normal word
                    processors are the following:
                </p><p>
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Professionally crafted layouts are available, which make a document
                            really look as if &#8220;printed.&#8221;
                            
                            
                            
                        </p></li><li><p>The typesetting of mathematical formulae is supported in a convenient
                            way.
                        </p></li><li><p>Users only need to learn a few easy-to-understand commands that
                            specify the logical structure of a document. They almost never need
                            to tinker with the actual layout of the document.
                        </p></li><li><p>Even  complex  structures  such  as  footnotes,  references,  table  of
                            contents, and bibliographies can be generated easily.
                        </p></li><li><p>Free add-on packages exist for many typographical tasks not directly
                            supported by basic LaTeX. For example, packages are available to
                            include <span class="sc">PostScript</span><a name="dx1-13003"></a> graphics or to typeset bibliographies conforming
                            to exact standards. Many of these add-on packages are described in
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>The LaTeX Companion</em></span>&nbsp;[<span class="citation">[?]</span>].
                        </p></li><li><p>LaTeX encourages authors to write well-structured texts, because this
                            is how LaTeX works&#8212;by specifying structure.
