<h1>What is a WebQuest?</h1>

<p>A stereotypical "WebQuest" sees a team of students accessing Web sites in order to produce a technology-enhanced group product. Example "WebQuests" are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students working as a team plan a trip across the US and present their itinerary on PowerPoint slides. One student might be responsible for budgeting, one for locating tourist attractions along the way, and one for booking accommodations and organizing meals.</li>
<li>Learners collect facts and images of endangered species and create a poster to share what they have learned.</li>
<li> Students create a brochure, diorama and audio guide for a new exhibit on an exotic animal being introduced to a zoo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the above activities may involve some reasonable learning, they are not WebQuests because in each case the information can go from the browser to product without altering (even entering?) the learner’s understanding.</p>

<p>A well-designed WebQuest uses the power of the Internet and a scaffolded learning process to turn research-based theories into dependable learning-centered practices.</p>
<p>"A WebQuest is a scaffolded learning structure…"</p>
<h1>What are the benefits of WebQuests?</h1>
<ul>
<li>When predictions are made about life and work for the coming decades, there are a few points on which there is nearly universal agreement</li>
<li>Tomorrows workers will need to be able to work in teams.</li>
<li>Individuals will move through several careers in the course of a lifetime.</li>
<li>The issues facing citizens will become more and more complex, and societal problems will resist easy fixes or black-and-white categorization.</li>
<li>The amount of information available to everyone will grow at an accelerating pace; much of it will come directly from a growing number of sources without filtering or verification.</li>
</ul>
